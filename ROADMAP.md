# Project Roadmap

Derived from Section 8 of `method_i_doc.txt`, this roadmap outlines the sequential phases for building the Method I Narrative Engine. Each phase references design decisions and prompts defined earlier in the document and guides implementation in manageable stages.

## Phase 1: Foundational Data Models and Schemas
1. **Define Character and Scene Schemas** âœ…
   - Create JSON or Pydantic models for Character Dossiers, Scene State Manager, Vector Indexes and In-Scene Grounding.
   - Validate example data against these schemas.
   - Set up database tables or JSON columns reflecting the schema structure.
2. **Implement "Living Dossier" Data Layer**
   - Establish data stores or placeholders for `psych_profile_index` and `linguistic_profile_index`.
   - Implement basic retrieval functions for memories and traits until a full vector DB is integrated.

## Phase 2: Core Logic and LLM Pipeline
3. **Develop Scene Generation Pipeline**
   - Implement the turn-by-turn sequence: retrieve context, invoke Inner Monologue LLM, invoke Dialogue & Action LLM, then update state.
   - Integrate the Inner Monologue and Dialogue prompt templates.
   - Parse JSON outputs and update Scene State; test with dummy responses.
4. **LLM Integration**
   - Connect the pipeline to OpenAI or another LLM provider.
   - Verify prompt formatting and handle errors or timeouts.
5. **Scene Conclusion Logic (Basic)**
   - Add a placeholder stopping rule such as max turns or manual stop to avoid infinite loops.

## Phase 3: Casting Call Subsystem
6. **Implement Character Extraction**
   - Build a service or endpoint that ingests text and uses the casting director prompt to return candidate characters.
   - Parse JSON responses from the prompt.
7. **Implement Review & Selection Logic**
   - Allow marking which extracted characters to keep, storing selections in memory or a database.
8. **Implement Dossier Compilation**
   - For selected candidates, call the dossier compiler prompt and validate returned JSON against the schema.
   - Persist compiled characters to the Characters database.
9. **Casting Call Integration**
   - Orchestrate extraction, selection and dossier compilation behind a single action or workflow.
   - Include logging and error handling for malformed LLM output.

## Phase 4: API Endpoints & Backend Services
10. **Design API Endpoints**
    - Implement FastAPI endpoints for Characters, Casting Call, Scenes, Scene Logs and Users based on the API contract.
    - Secure endpoints if authentication is required.
11. **Database Wiring**
    - Connect endpoints to database tables for characters, scenes and turns using SQLAlchemy or similar.
12. **Internal Module Refactoring**
    - Organize code into modules for dossiers, scene generation, casting call and user management.

## Phase 5: Frontend Development (UI Implementation)
13. **Build Scene Builder UI**
    - Components for character selection, premise entry, transcript display and next-turn generation with loading states.
14. **Build Characters Tab UI**
    - List, edit and delete characters via API calls.
15. **Build Casting Call Tab UI**
    - Interface for entering source text, reviewing candidates and compiling dossiers.
16. **Build Users Tab UI**
    - CRUD interface for user accounts.
17. **Build Scene Logs Tab UI**
    - Display past scenes and allow viewing full transcripts.
18. **Integrate UI with Auth (optional)**
    - Implement login flow and attach tokens to API requests if authentication is used.

## Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
19. **End-to-End Testing**
    - Test character creation, scene generation, transcript logging and dossier editing, including edge cases and error handling.
20. **Performance Tuning (Basic)**
    - Measure turn generation latency and identify obvious inefficiencies.

## Phase 7: Deployment and DevOps
21. **Prepare Deployment Artifacts**
    - Create Dockerfiles or configure Vercel/Fly.io settings and ensure environment variables are externalized.
22. **Deployment (Initial Launch)**
    - Deploy frontend and backend to their respective platforms and run smoke tests.
23. **Deployment Checklist Verification**
    - Verify services, environment variables, seeding and security settings; set up monitoring or alerts.
24. **Documentation & Handoff**
    - Provide user and developer documentation, including prompt designs and architectural overviews.

## Phase 8: Post-Launch and Scalability Preparations
25. **Collect Feedback & Observations**
    - Monitor performance and user feedback to assess scene coherence and system reliability.
26. **Plan Scalability Enhancements**
    - Prioritize tasks such as vector DB migration or microservice refactors based on observed bottlenecks.
27. **Iterative Improvements**
    - Schedule follow-up versions (e.g., Pinecone migration, character microservices, scene analyzers).
28. **Final Goal**
    - Achieve a scalable, autonomous narrative engine that supports many concurrent scenes with consistent dramatic quality.
